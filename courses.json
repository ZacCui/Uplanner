Journalists have had to grapple with complex science in new ways.

Woven through the course is a critical examination of the interaction between the criminal justice system and the criminal law: specifically, that application of the law is shaped by and dependent on decisions made by criminal justice actors including police, prosecutors and judicial officers. Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.<br />\n<br />\nCrime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above.

Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.\u00a0 It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined &#39;results&#39;, or rather just one.

Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism\u2019s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law\u2019s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain \u2018problems\u2019 of contemporary legal practice. </p>", "keywords": "law,legal theory", "name": "Legal Theory", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "teaching_period_display": "Term 1, Term 2, Term 3", "url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/Undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS2320/"}, "LAWS2326": {"URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT": "/Undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS2326/", "code": "LAWS2326", "contact_hours": "4", "credit_points": "6", "description": "<p>This course seeks to understand the nature of law and justice and, in particular, the relationship between the two, in contemporary society.

It traces the historical development of equity and its relationship with common law. Students will critically consider the appropriate application of a range of equitable doctrines to particular scenarios and the availability of different remedies. Students will also be introduced to the law of trusts and, in particular, the nature of a trust, legal requirements in establishing a trust as well as the rights, duties and powers associated with trusts. The course assumes familiarity with equitable doctrines taught in Principles of Private Law and Contracts (alternatively Contracts 1 and 2), for instance estoppel, undue influence, unconscionability. For students who have not completed Principles of Private Law, the course will include a transitional module on personal property to introduce subject matter that was previously taught in Property, Equity and Trusts and will in future be taught in Principles of Private Law. This is an important pre-requisite for learning about trusts, which involve property.<br />\n<br />\nThis course is one of the core subjects for law and will normally be taken after completion of Contracts. It fits within the private law stream, which includes such subjects as Torts, Contracts and Land Law. It provides a good grounding for further studies in this area.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the course will incorporate on-line and classroom tutorials that teach students how to refine their skills in retrieving legal research, working through complex legal research problems and writing up research in professional contexts. These modules are ONLY required for students who have NOT completed Advanced Legal Research (ALR). Those students will be assigned to &#34;tutorial&#34; groups for the purposes of these modules.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less<br />settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific<br />social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held<br />and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think within these categories and<br />arrangements, rather than about them.</p>\n<p><br />Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is<br />concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it<br />works and how it changes. Social theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people<br />live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite<br />unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions it plays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society. In probing these questions we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.</p>\n<p><br />This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical issues concerning the intricate and complex relationships<br />between law and society. It seeks to do this by acquainting them with several important ways of approaching these<br />issues, and with the sorts of questions best (and worst) addressed by each of these approaches.</p>\n<p><br />The course materials are composed of two interlocking parts, each of which seeks to introduce students to a distinct<br />range of questions\u2014and a distinct way of asking such questions\u2014about socio-legal relations.</p>\n<p><br />Part 1\u2014Law and Modernity: Classical Social Theory on Law in Modern Society</p>\n<p>Classical social theory was born in nineteenth century Europe, that is, at a time and in a place which was undergoing<br />massive and unprecedented social, economic, scientific and intellectual change. The early social theories differed<br />markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which<br />were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u201cgreat<br />transformation\u201d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been<br />considered as urgently or directly before.</p>\n<p><br />Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and<br />complex societies \u201chang together\u201d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the<br />law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are<br />not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised<br />techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the<br />attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.</p>\n<p>1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?<br />2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?<br />3.

They grant foreign investors broad protections from interference by the governments of the countries in which they invest.

The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris\u2019 recent case against Australia arising from Australia\u2019s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them.

It examines the following question: What does the concept &#34;biology&#34;\u00a0<em>do</em>\u00a0in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as &#34;nature&#34;, &#34;bodies&#34;, &#34;organism&#34;, &#34;groups&#34; or &#34;life&#34; (to name just a few). &#34;Law and Biology&#34; aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.</p>\n<p>The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similarto these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students wishing to think about law \u201coutside the box&#34; and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.

At the same time students will be critically analysing the effect of law and police practices on disadvantaged clients in a community legal centre setting. Students will be assisting Solicitors in advising clients in making complaints against the police, as well as conducting work on research, policy and community legal education under the supervision of the Police Powers Clinic convenor. Through client work, advocacy and law reform projects and a weekly two hour seminar, the program aims to strengthen students&#39; practical skills in research, writing, advocacy, problem-solving, team work and independent judgment. Students will spend 1 day (7 hours-9am to 5pm) at Redfern Legal Centre each week for 12 weeks. There will be a half-day induction program at the Centre which is compulsory for all students.</p>", "keywords": "law,clinical legal education,clinic,social justice,police powers,redfern legal centre,experiential learning", "name": "Police Powers Clinic", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "teaching_period_display": "Term 1, Term 2, Term 3", "url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/Undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS3319/", "enrol_conditions": "Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses."}, "LAWS3321": {"URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT": "/Undergraduate/courses/2019/LAWS3321/", "code": "LAWS3321", "contact_hours": "3", "credit_points": "6", "description": "<p></p>\n<p>Different legal systems have evolved in different parts of the world.

It begins by exploring the question \u201cwhat is justice\u201d? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice?

The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take,<br />and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and<br />doctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled<br />institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by<br />the legal system, rather than about them.</p>\n<p><br />Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe and<br />discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters of<br />description and analysis - what&#39;s going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about<br />what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such<br />questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors -<br />are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and<br />impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely<br />questioned.</p>\n<p>Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these<br />issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives them<br />opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought<br />about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or<br />even discussion at all.</p>\n<p><br />Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined &#39;results&#39;, or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they<br />emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe<br />new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions<br />discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.</p>\n<p>In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas \u2013 legal<br />positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about<br />political life. Legalpositivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently<br />of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves<br />as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they<br />contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.</p>\n<p><br />Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These<br />include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory<br />between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism\u2019s relationship to rights and to cultural and<br />religious difference, and law\u2019s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.</p>\n<p>In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain \u2018problems\u2019 of contemporary legal practice.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think <em>within</em> these categories and arrangements, rather than <em>about</em> them.</p>\n<p>Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. <em>Social</em> theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society.

The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u201cgreat transformation\u201d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies \u201chang together\u201d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.

These insights and frameworks focus on concepts such as the public/private divide, equality and intersectional discrimination, representation and power. The course will examine various areas of human experience such as work and the economy, the family and relationships, reproduction and bodies, representation and expression, and the way in which law shapes these.

The second part of the course examines criticisms of the link between constitutionalism and popular sovereignty that emerged in response to the revolutionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. These will include Marxist and anarchist claim that the state cannot realise popular self-determination and so needs to be eliminated through revolution, and the reactionary argument that democracy undermines law, order and morality. The final section of the course explores the radical democratic turn of critical theory since the 1970s and its tendency to critique law and rights while appropriating them for emancipatory politics. The course will situate these theories in their historical context and examine their contemporary relevance in the activities of existing social movements.

These include a thorough understanding of the biomedical science mechanisms and bio-social determinants that maintain health, contribute to illness, and underlie appropriate management strategies; application of a scientific approach to clinical medicine and medical practice; excellent communicative, teamwork, psychomotor and cognitive skills to assess health issues and patient problems and develop patient-centred management approaches; and demonstrated abilities to work independently, reflectively and within appropriate ethical and legal frameworks.</p>\n<p>Clinical learning in phase 3 will be predominantly located in clinical environments associated with the Faculty of Medicine in a range of metropolitan and rural locations throughout New South Wales. Most modules will be available in a variety of clinical locations and students will be able to select an individualised learning program from a menu offered by clinical teaching units, or they may be able to negotiate their program with their clinical supervisors. Students will generally be able to indicate a preference to do the majority of their clinical training attached to one geographical region, but final allocation will be determined by a number of factors including availability of attachments to particular locations, and is ultimately the responsibility and decision of the Faculty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students are required to complete one each of six clinical modules with a specified major focus, these being in the clinical disciplines of Children&#39;s Health; Women&#39;s Health; Mental Health; Internal Medicine; Surgery; and Chronic &amp; Complex Care, although some choice of the structure, case-mix and location of each of these will generally be possible. In addition to these specified modules, students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete phase 3 requirements. The order and content of work undertaken in these courses will be organised for each student on an individual basis through the relevant Clinical School(s).</p>\n<p>In considering their choice of modules in Phase 3, the student&#39;s clinical experience must include a minimum of 8 weeks in community or ambulatory settings, as well as 8 weeks experience of emergency or critical care, although these may be spread over one or more individual modules.

Although structured teaching activities are generally limited to an average of 10 hours per week, which will include teaching of relevant biomedical sciences and social sciences, students are required to work under supervision as part of the health care delivery unit. Students&#39; responsibilities as part of the team will increase gradually as new skills are developed. Each module will have demonstrable links to those aspects of basic biomedical and social sciences relevant to the health issues encountered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assessment for each module will focus on the performance of students relative to the desired graduate capabilities.

As planners we are interested in the inherently spatial dimensions of these urban processes, recognising that collective efforts to influence land use change and behaviours of urban stakeholders take place at different geographical scales, and impact on different groups in different ways. This course focuses on the metropolitan scale, where the conditions requiring strategic planning are arguably most evident.</p>", "keywords": "planning and urban development,strategic planning,spatial planning,critical planning theory,spatial policy,metropolitan planning,regional growth plans,subregional strategies", "name": "Strategic Planning", "study_level": "Undergraduate", "teaching_period_display": "Term 1", "url": "https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/Undergraduate/courses/2019/PLAN2001/"}, "PLAN2002": {"URL_MAP_FOR_CONTENT": "/Undergraduate/courses/2019/PLAN2002/", "code": "PLAN2002", "contact_hours": "4", "credit_points": "6", "description": "<p></p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p>This course deals with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and their applications in urban studies, public management, and environment planning contexts.

This permits the evaluation of predicted consequences associated with different interventions, before these are actually implemented. MCDA allows decisions to be made when the decision-maker is faced with multiple and conflicting objectives where tradeoffs must be made, which is most often the case in the real world. Netica and SuperDecisions are free-ware software implementing Bayesian networks and MCDA, respectively, which students will use during the course to solve decision problems from a range of application fields.\u00a0<br /> <br /> Finally the course will discuss current issues in behavioural risk management and the value of first-line employees\u2019 experience, such as their ability to identify \u2018early warnings\u2019 about risk, and what an organisation can do to encourage such employees to speak up without the fear of retribution.

In this class the so-called &#39;rise of the APT&#39; is examined from a number of perspectives: against the backdrop of the explosion of international art events known as Biennales of Art and against the question of the usefulness of the concept of an Asia-Pacific region, given changing economic and political conditions. Does this region have any uniformity or integration artistically, economically or politically? Whose art is included? What is excluded in events such as the APT? In sum the Asa-Pacific Treiennials are prisms with which to look at broader events in the region in the last twenty years. In this course we move from an in-depth examination of the history of the Asia-Pacific Triennials to an examination of other events and institutions such as the White Rabbit Gallery in Sydney and the 4A Gallery, as well as new state museums and cultural centres such as Tjibaou Cultural Centre in New Caledonia and Te Papa in New Zealand.

How accurate will the answers be, and how can they be checked? One need not understand all the mathematics of the finite element to answer these questions. However a competent user must have an understanding of the preliminary mathematics and must be able to understand how elements behave in order to choose suitable kinds, sizes and shapes of elements, and to guard against misinterpretations and unrealistically high expectations.
